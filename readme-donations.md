# Please, donate!

A lot of work was done to to make everything usable together, to write
docs and explanations of each plugin behavior, to test it under different OS's,
to make gifs and to spread information about it. And there is still a lot of
work to do: new plugins, new features to old plugins, adding tests to make
plugins supportable and a lot of bugfixing and debugging. Without support I will
not be able to do that work.

To say "thank you" for all who donated I'm introducing following benefits to
everybody who will donate certain amounts:

- $10 - you'll get access to secret useless plugin (but that plugin makes a fun,
  yeah)

- $50 - you'll get access to secret useful plugin; I consider it quite useful
  but still it can be useless for you; however I promise that each developer
  hits problem (that this plugin tries to solve) every day

This amounts probably will be interesting for companies as sublime-enhanced will
get more visitors:

- $250 - your company name (or any message) and one line of text under it will
  be listed at the bottom of main page of sublime-enhanced repository (or any
  repository of sublime-enhanced on your choise)

- $500 - bugfix request will be performed ASAP

- $1000 - feature request to will be performed ASAP

- $2000 - I can do a new plugin on request; please contact me to see if it
  possible to do your idea as plugin

- [more] - I hereby promise to travel to your location for several days and meet
  donator personally during next 6 month of donation if amount covers travel
  expenses;

Please, specify link at your github account when donating so I'll be able to
contact you and share plugins. If you forgot to do it, then just drop me github
message with date, time, amount and email of donation. Please wait 48 hours (I
have only two hands) before contact me again in a case if I'll not contact you
back.

Note if you donate anything more or qual than $50 you'll automatically get
access to everything above in the list (e.g. if you donate $250, your message
will be published and you'll get access to two secret plugins).

Note that secret plugins listed above is still open source, released under MIT
license: you will be able to fork it, to publish it or to do whatever you want
with it. Probably you already can download it (or see description) somewhere in
internet but it will spoil the game =) Feel free to share secret plugins with
your friends or colleagues but please do not publish it (or its description)
online as it spoil the game (at least for first plugin) for other people.

For bugfix/feature request: please open a bug request prior to donation and
wait for my reply ("won't fix" issues will be closed only in forks); when
you'll donate refer to opened issue in donation message.
